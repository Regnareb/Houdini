This is a collection of tools to set default preferences automatically and make Houdini more usable.


## Default Preferences

* Disable Nodes Shapes  
* Use Simple Node Shapes  
* Disable Auto Move Nodes  
* Disable Nodes Animations  
* Set Low Size to Show Ring  
* Show Displayed Node instead Of Selected Node  
* Create Tools In Context  
* Set UI to Compact Mode  
* Startup with a specific Desktop  



## On Open Scene

* Apply the default Desktop
* Set Cooking mode to manual, to prevent heavy scenes to crash when you open them  
* Set view to "Show Display Operator", when set to "Current/Selected Operator" Houdini will cook the selected node too, it can lead to a lot of slowness and even crashes  
* Set view to "Hide other objects", it makes the loading of new scenes a lot faster
